    <h1> Welcome to Poland!</h1>

    <p> Warsaw is a perfect blend of history and modern energy. I wandered through the beautifully restored Old Town, listened to a live Chopin concert in Łazienki Park, and learned about the city’s history in the museum. The best part? The pierogi at Babka’s Pierogi Pantry. These were soft, cheesy dumplings served with sour cream. If you are ever in Warsaw, you have to try some.</p>
