    <h1>Terrific Tigers</h1>

    <p>The tiger is my favourite animal! Tigers are big, strong, and have beautiful orange fur with black stripes. During the day, a tigerâ€™s   stripes can act as camouflage, allowing it to blend in with its surroundings for stalking and ambushing its prey.</p>

    <p>They are found in forests and grasslands, and they are excellent hunters. Sadly, tigers are endangered, and we need to protect them.</p>

  <p>India is the country with the most tigers. A large deer can provide a tiger with one week's food, but only one out of every ten hunts is successful. </p>
