    <h1> Welcome to Scotland!</h1>

    <p> Edinburgh is like stepping into a storybook, with its grand castles, winding alleyways, and the sound of bagpipes filling the air. I hiked up Arthur’s Seat for an incredible city view and explored the spooky underground vaults. The real highlight was a plate of haggis, neeps, and tatties at Maggie’s Haggis Hut. This was peppery and surprisingly delicious! </p>
