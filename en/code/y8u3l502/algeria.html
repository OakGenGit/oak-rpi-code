    <h1> Welcome to Algeria!</h1>

    <p> Algiers is an interesting mix of French and Arabic influences. It has white-washed buildings and bustling markets. I got lost in the Casbahâ€™s maze-like streets, then watched the sunset along the Corniche. My favourite find was a little restaurant called Chez Yasmine. I had the fluffiest couscous with slow-cooked lamb and spiced vegetables, it was delicious!</p>
