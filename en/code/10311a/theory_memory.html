		<h2>Primary storage</h2>
        	<p>Why do computers have primary storage?</p>
        	<p>Primary memory is the computerâ€™s main memory, 
            which is directly accessible by the CPU and often
            much faster than secondary storage. Primary 
            storage is made up of RAM and ROM.</p>
