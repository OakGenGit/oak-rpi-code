        <h1>Programming</h1>

        <p> Programming is how we give computers instructions to make them do what we want. These instructions are written in special languages that help us talk to computers. Just like a recipe tells you how to make a dish, programming tells a computer how to perform tasks, like solving problems, showing information, or running apps. When we write code, we tell the computer exactly what to do, and it follows those steps to get things done.</p>

        <p>These programs can run on many different devices and machines. Whether itâ€™s a phone, a laptop, a video game console, or even a smart refrigerator, each device uses software, which is made through programming, to work. From simple tasks like checking the weather to complicated things like controlling robots, programming helps make technology do what we need. </p>
