      <h1>Network Topologies</h1>
        <p>Network topologies define how computers and devices are 
          arranged in a network. The main types include:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#bus">Bus Topology</a></li>
            <li><a href="#star">Star Topology</a></li>
            <li><a href="#mesh">Mesh Topology</a></li>
        </ul>
  
      <h2 id="bus">Bus Topology</h2>
        <p>In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single 
          central cable. It is simple and cost-effective but can be 
          slow with high traffic.</p>
   
      <h2 id="star">Star Topology</h2>
        <p>In a star topology, all devices connect to a central hub 
          or switch. It is reliable but more expensive due to extra 
          hardware.</p>
          
      <h2 id="mesh">Mesh Topology</h2>
        <p>In a mesh topology, each device is connected to multiple 
          others. It offers redundancy but requires more cables and 
          configuration.</p>
