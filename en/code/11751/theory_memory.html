		<h2 id="primary-storage">Primary Storage</h2>
    <p>Why do computers have primary storage?</p>
    <p>Primary storage is the computer’s main memory, which is directly accessible by the CPU and often much faster than secondary storage. Primary storage consists of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>RAM (Random Access Memory) – Temporary, volatile memory that stores data currently being used by the system.</li>
        <li>ROM (Read-Only Memory) – Non-volatile memory that contains essential instructions, such as the computer’s boot process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="secondary-storage">Secondary Storage</h2>
    <p>Why is secondary storage needed?</p>
    <p>Unlike primary storage, secondary storage is used to store data long-term, even when the computer is turned off. Types of secondary storage include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) – Traditional magnetic storage, commonly used in computers.</li>
        <li>SSDs (Solid State Drives) – Faster, more durable storage with no moving parts.</li>
        <li>Optical Discs – CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays for storing media and software.</li>
        <li>Flash Storage – USB drives and memory cards for portable data storage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="units">Units</h2>
    <p>How is data measured?</p>
    <p>Computers store data in binary (1s and 0s). Storage capacity is measured in units such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bit – The smallest unit of data (0 or 1).</li>
        <li>Byte – 8 bits.</li>
        <li>Kilobyte (KB) – 1,024 bytes.</li>
        <li>Megabyte (MB) – 1,024 KB.</li>
        <li>Gigabyte (GB) – 1,024 MB.</li>
        <li>Terabyte (TB) – 1,024 GB.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="data-storage">Data Storage</h2>
    <p>How do different types of data get stored?</p>
    <p>Computers store different types of data using various file formats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Text files (.txt, .docx) – Store written information.</li>
        <li>Image files (.jpg, .png, .gif) – Store pictures and graphics.</li>
        <li>Audio files (.mp3, .wav) – Store sound recordings and music.</li>
        <li>Video files (.mp4, .avi) – Store moving images and sound.</li>
        <li>Executable files (.exe) – Contain instructions for running programs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="compression">Compression</h2>
    <p>Why do we use compression?</p>
    <p>Compression reduces the size of files so they take up less storage space and are quicker to transfer. There are two main types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lossy Compression – Removes some data to make the file smaller. Used in images (JPEG), audio (MP3), and video (MP4).</li>
        <li>Lossless Compression – Reduces file size without losing data. Used in text files (ZIP) and images (PNG).</li>
    </ul>
